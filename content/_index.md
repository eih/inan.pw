I am a front end developer who's currently part of a Scrum team at [Christian Aid](https://www.caid.org.uk/). I am responsible for creating [mobile first websites](https://www.christianaid.org.uk/), creating a Drupal 8 theme for the organisation, maintaining a [pattern library](http://patterns.christianaid.org.uk/) for CA design system, improving the existing workflow and some more.

## Current stack and workflow

I work with Drupal 8, twig, SCSS, ES6, BEM/Atomic Design, Pattern Lab, MySQL, PHP. We have a collaborative and UX oriented development workflow involving user tests/research, git/git-flow (with feature branch builds), QA (a11y, automated visual regression, integration tests), demos/sprint reviews.

I have a good understanding of MVC patterns and always try to produce DRY, reusable code. I always try to follow best practices.

I am active on Drupal Slack and [Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/u/hocu).

### Other tools and technologies

- Drupal, Wordpress and bespoke CMS systems
- Ruby, PHP, node, Python, Scala and related frameworks
- CSS processors and frameworks
- JS libraries (React, jQuery, Underscore/Lodash), bundlers and task runners
- Visual regression test tools (Wraith, Backstop.js), and JS testing libraries (Jest)
